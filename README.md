Project Example Idea 2: Build a website for a gym.

Consists of the gym name with a navbar consisting of all the sections. (Home, Services, Prices, Classes, Gallery and Contact Us)

I added a banner with an image and a header consisting of a small paragraph for the Home page.

User can join up by clicking on the prices section and it gives you 3 options.

Users can get in touch by clicking on the Contact Us section and filling out a form or can click on the social media platforms.

There is a fitness class schedule by clicking on the classes section.

I added a few hover features on this site on the nav bar list items, the Join Now buttons in the Price section, the social media icons and the Send Message button in the Contact Us section
