Project Example Idea 2: Build a website for a gym.

Consists of the gym name with a navbar consisting of all the sections. (Home, Services, Prices, Classes, Gallery and Contact Us)

I added a banner with an image and a header consisting of a small introductory paragraph for the Home page.

User can join up by clicking on the prices section and it gives you 3 options.

Users can get in touch by clicking on the Contact Us section and filling out a form or can click on the social media platforms.

There is a fitness class schedule by clicking on the classes section.

I added a few hover features on this site including the login buttons and join now buttons

I added a seperate page using a login button  where existing members can login using their username and password and new users can create an account 

I created a hamburger menu for the navbar which will be visible in Responsive view of less than or equal to 800px.
